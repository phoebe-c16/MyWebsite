            We focus strongly on the plastic pollution and this is because of the sever increase we have seen in its
            production and it horrific impacts .Mass plastic production first rose its highest between the 1950s and
            1970s, where the amount being produced increased twentyfold (Chalmin 2019), followed by multiple increases.
            Another such increase was from 2011-2016 where plastic production was seen to rise by 20%, creating a
            56million tonne growth (Pan et al. 2019) and now around 5.25 trillion plastic particles sail the oceanâ€™s
            surface (Hohn et al. 2020). Annually the amount of plastic that reaches the ocean is equivalent to a
            municipal bin lorry dumping its load every minute, this marine plastic debris accumulates in gyres and is
            found in both the shallowest and deepest parts of the ocean, made possible via systems such as ocean
            currents and thermohaline circulation. Over the course of transportation, exposure to abiotic factors cause
            the breakdown of certain plastics into microbeads. These toxic particles of plastic are the primary micro
            plastics(Pan et al. 2019) and are small enough for marine life to ingest, creating a global pollution issue,
            which not only effects a great amount of marine life but also people. This is because once ingested by
            marine life its unable to breakdown and so goes on to pollute the worldwide supply of seafood. It also
            effects many non-aquatic organisms like marine birds(Donnelly-Greenan et al. 2019). Other primary
            microplastics come from everyday garments just from being washed, as this causes the release of plastics and
            goes on into the environment from waste water not being effectively treat(Pan et al. 2019).</p>

        <br>
        <p>Currently only around 5-10% of plastic waste is recovered and recycled, if this does not change in the future
            the ocean will be 50% plastic and 50% marine life. Plastics are very harmful for marine biota, it was
            estimated from organisms such as zooplankton to apex predators that over 2,200 separate marine species were
            found with plastic in their gastrointestinal tract (Hohn et al. 2020), and causes many other problems such
            as choking, intestinal blockages, starvation, entanglement etc . Plastics also reduce the amount of CO2
            absorbed by the ocean from the atmosphere aiding global warming. Plastic is light weight, durable and cost
            effective which is why it has become very popular over the years. However, for countless reasons it is vital
            we keep studying plastic and the effects it has, so we can change the way it is used and disposed.</p>
